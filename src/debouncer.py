"""
Speaker ID debouncing for stable camera tracking.

Removes rapid speaker-ID bounces that cause jarring crop window snaps.

def debounce_speaker_ids(speaker_track_ids, min_hold_frames=15):
    """
    Remove rapid speaker-ID bounces shorter than min_hold_frames.

    Speaker detection sometimes flickers the active-speaker label during
    crosstalk or brief classification uncertainty, producing 1-10 frame
    segments that cause jarring rapid-fire crop snaps. This pre-filter
    replaces those short segments with the surrounding stable speaker ID
    so the downstream dead-zone tracker never sees them.

    Algorithm:
      1. Run-length encode the raw IDs into (track_id, start, length) runs.
      2. For any run shorter than min_hold_frames, replace it with the
         previous stable run's ID (or the next stable run if it's the first).
      3. Expand back to a per-frame list.

    Args:
        speaker_track_ids: Per-frame list of speaker IDs (int or None).
            None means no speaker detected at that frame.
        min_hold_frames: Minimum frames a speaker must hold to be "stable".

    Returns:
        Same-length list with short flicker runs replaced by nearest stable ID.
        None segments are never modified.

    Examples:
        >>> debounce_speaker_ids([0]*50 + [1]*3 + [0]*50, min_hold_frames=10)
        [0]*103  # The 3-frame speaker-1 segment is replaced by speaker 0

        >>> debounce_speaker_ids([None]*10 + [0]*50, min_hold_frames=15)
        [None]*10 + [0]*50  # None segments are untouched
